## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Can I use this to move to a hosting provider other than GoDaddy? ###

They would have to explicitly support this plugin. But all the code is in here, along with integration instructions, so other web hosts can certainly use it.

### Can this be used to migrate from one GoDaddy Managed WordPress hosting site to another GoDaddy Managed WordPress site? ###

Yes!
